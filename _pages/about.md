# About Me
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Tokyo Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yusuke Narita](https://www.yusuke-narita.com/) (Yale University) and [Prof. Nathan Kallus](http://www.nathankallus.com/) (Cornell Univeristy) during my undergrad study.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference called _counterfactual machine learning_.
I am interested in the counterfactual nature of logged bandit feedback obtained from interactive systems, and ways of using biased real-world datasets to assist better decision making. Most recently, I have been focusing on bridging the gap between theory and practice in counterfactual machine learning.

**Presentation slides for the contributed talk at the REVEAL workshop is now available [here](https://usaito.github.io/files/REVEAL2020_OpenBandit_slides.pdf)**.
