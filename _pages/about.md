# About Me
I am a forth year undergraduate at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

My research is at the intersection of Machine Learning and Causal Inference called Counterfactual Machine Learning.
I am interested in the counterfactual nature of logged bandit feedback obtaied from interactive systems.
Most recently, I have been focusing on the intersection between Counterfactual Machine Learning and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.

# Research Interests
- Counterfactual Machine Learning
    - Offline evaluation of bandit policies
    - Debiasing recommender systems
    - Unbiased Learning-to-Rank
- Causal Inference
- Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
