# About Me
I am a fourth year undergraduate at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference called counterfactual machine learning.
I am interested in the counterfactual nature of logged bandit feedback obtained from interactive systems, and ways of using biased real-world datasets to assist better decision making. Most recently, I have been focusing on the intersection of counterfactual machine learning and information information retrieval.

# Research Interests
- Counterfactual Machine Learning
    - Offline evaluation of bandit policies
    - Debiasing recommender systems
    - Unbiased Learning-to-Rank
